# 5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel Notation 


https://github.com/GHXX/FiveDChessDataInterface

An **unofficial** program based on https://github.com/GHXX/FiveDChessDataInterface for saving notation from games of [5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/).

## Disclaimer
While it should be stable for the most part, this library may still cause crashes/desyncs or other unexpected/unwanted behaviour, hence why the developers of this project cannot be held liable for any damage caused.


## Usage
Start this program while 5D chess is running (or vice versa). After you finish a game with at least 4 moves, a file with the name `5dpgn<date>_<time>.txt` will be saved in the folder you ran the program from. This contains the move information, but doesn't contain the name of the variant.
